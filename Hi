Hi everyone, I apologize for my English but I use the google translator.  I live in Modena (Italy) and I can say that I am quite familiar with android systems, I signed up mainly to get support on a certain app but in addition to this to find out many other interesting things and if I am able to make a contribution too to help others ... a good continuation to all.
